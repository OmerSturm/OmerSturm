## ðŸ”¥aboutðŸ”¥
> I have been learning software development for about a year now (2022),
looking to expand my knowledge and build a lot of cool stuff with the community!

<br/>

## ðŸ¦¾SkilsðŸ¦¾
> I am most comfortable working with c# as it was the first programing language I learned and built most projects in, ranging from web apps with the dot net framework to games with the unity game engine,but i can also hold my own when working with javascript or python.<br/><br/>
I also have some experience working with CSS and HTML as I build all of the UI for my websites myself.<br/><br/>I'm quick to pick up new teqnolagis and always want to learn more!
